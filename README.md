At the beginning of 2021 I decided to review programming and data structures concepts so I've chosen the C language because it provides the programmer the ability to study pointers and dynamic memory allocation, therefore understanding how data structures work and how they are implemented.
In this repository there are many proposed exercises I've answered from the book: "Lu√≠s Dama, Linguagem C, 10th edition, 2007" which is a great C book.
